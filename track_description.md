# Intelligent Edge Computing in Pervasive Environments Minitrack

## Track

Software Technology

## Description

We would like to invite papers which focus on developing new paradigms for addressing the synergy of software, devices, moveable objects, networks, and people, in one constantly changeable world of pervasive computing, where computational and human intelligence are spreading everywhere. The idea is to debate challenges of empowering edges of computer networks and adding computational intelligence to them. An additional goal would be to analyze the future of the IoT and its speedy transformation into a constantly changeable set of new types of connected devices, typical of pervasive computing, which might be wearables, belong to soft robotics, represent computational materials, and enable human machine augmentations. In all these examples, edge computing plays a very important role, and it is no surprise that we have started thinking how to equip the edges of computer networks with intelligence.

There are many challenges in the world of pervasive environments, typical of the IoT, where we wish to use edge computing.  Most of them stumble upon the potentially uncertain future of replacing powerful cloud computing with new paradigms in which intelligent edge computing may take centre stage. Therefore, it is worthwhile exploring what exactly edge computing brings to the world of pervasive computing and how we could make this new computing paradigm become “intelligent edge”. Topics of interests include:

### Edge Computing Paradigm
* Evaluation of computational models for Cloud computing and their suitability for creating the IoT and pervasive environments in general.
* The role of Edge/Fog computing in making the IoT operational and reconsidering the role of Clouds in current IoT implementations
* Pushing data and computational intelligence, with analytic platforms, away from centralized Clouds and the rise of serverless computing
* Promoting localized computing, with Edge/Cloudlets/Fog in mind, and addressing the constantly changeable IoT, typical in pervasive computing.
* Examples of computing paradigms suitable for implementations of the IoT across Edge/Fog/Cloudlets/Clouds.

### Creating Intelligent Edge Computing
* Feasibility of creating intelligence “at the edge” which could share computations and data between Clouds, Fog and Cloudlets.
* Using learning and predictive technologies by defining models for machine learning algorithms and types of AI solutions which could create intelligent computational edge
* Potential convergence of humans,” things” and AI in creating edge intelligence
* Possibilities of defining a computational continuum by utilizing the space between localized computing and clouds and thus enhance the intelligence at the edge
* Software architectures for supporting intelligence at the computational edge for the purpose of creating solutions in automation, manufacturing, businesses, medicine, healthcare delivery, education, and governance.

### Edge Computing for/in Human Augmentation, Internet of Materials and Human centered Cognitive IoT
* The role of edge computing in creating augmentation of human with machines and vice versa.
* Promoting intelligent engineering for designing cognitive devices ready to accommodate edge intelligence
* Investigating computational materials, shape changing computing particles and internet of materials as potential factors for empowering intelligent edge and enhancing pervasive computing
* Pushing forward the fusion of computational materials with hardware/software synergy typical of binary/ternary/quantum computers
* Cognitive enabled edge computing and a journey towards human centered cognitive IoT, and pervasive environments in general
